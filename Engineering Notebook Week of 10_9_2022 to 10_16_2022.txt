Part of the team met on Sunday, between Helen, Alek, and me to determine who would be in charge of which portion - in our case - who is in charge of hardware, who is in charge of software development, and who is in charge of integrating. I was assigned to be the Software lead, with Nathan being the assistant that will help figure out software items that could be an issue/risk. I personally don't see how any issues or risk coming up with the software side, other than it not working properly, and debugging is going to be a large part of our journey in the software side of things. 

I will begin with researching through optimal coding practices for hardware to allow for robotic walking, algorithms, or examples of what code would look like in the case of allowing dynamic movement of robotic legs. Coordinate with Hardware to ensure that code matches with hardware legs to allow for the movement to match the design of the legs. I plan to look into other Poppy leg code design, hopefully looking for inspiration from other teams that have worked on adding legs to Poppy.
