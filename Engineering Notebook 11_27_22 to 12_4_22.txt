Engineering Notebook Week of 11/27/22 to 12/4/22

I haven’t been updating this as I should, but I haven’t really been working on the project all that much other than writing up words for the reports and going to our weekend weekly meetings. I was put in charge of the problem specification section of the engineering specification report. I was trying to put as much in as possible, but the example seemed to have a lot of fluff that seemed to just be there for padding the report a little bit.
I also have been looking at algorithms/concepts for presenting to our sponsors that would allow for an easier project but still meets all expectations and requirements. The only concepts I’ve been able to find that look promising to satisfy all requirements is machine learning using reinforcement algorithms to teach Poppy what the right movement would be to walk. I’ve also been looking at ways in which to move Poppy in a more deliberate way, using hard coded motor control, but hardcoding seems to be the opposite of what the sponsors want, but machine learning might take too long to figure out to get the correct behavior that we would expect of a walking robot. I’ve watched many videos on how reinforcement learning works with robotic movement, and it showed hundred of hours needed for getting the correct behavior, and I believe we have too little time for this kind of commitment.
