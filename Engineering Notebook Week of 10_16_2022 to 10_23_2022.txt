We worked on researching on Poppy Legs and functionality for getting it implemented. We met with the project sponsors, Bill Michael and Dr. Atyabi, and they gave us some insight into what we should be looking into. I have learned that I need to begin looking into algorithms for the movement of the degrees of freedom for each portion of the legs. The knee of the leg should only have one degree, but we need to decide as a group the degrees of freed we want/need to achieve our goals. I have looked into software examples for Poppy, but have not looked into any specific algorithms for robotic movement yet, it is a goal that I have by the end of the week. 

I have discovered several GitHub Repositories for other Poppy projects, and it has given me several ideas for getting coding the Poppy legs, and I have been looking into the Poppy Python Library to see if there are any interesting or easily implemented functions inside.
