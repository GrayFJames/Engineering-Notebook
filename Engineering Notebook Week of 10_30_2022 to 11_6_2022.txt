We have been researching into the Poppy legs competitors. Also, we've been looking into designs, algorithms, and other topics that could help us with designing Poppy. I have been looking into systems for coding the robot in Python, and how we would load the program for the robot to begin working. Arduino seems to be the most common form of controller for the Poppy robot. I am unsure of what the robots runs on, as of today, so I will need to figure out what sort of system it has for working on the robot. I have found websites pertaining to underactuated robots, and algorithms for bipedal movement, although some of them don't make sense to me as of right now. I will need to talk with Bill about this idea, since I believe he was the one to offer the idea.

We will be going over the different items we found while researching this Saturday, the 5th of November. This week, I've been a little swamped with other school projects, so I haven't been able to research in depth into any specific topic. I am also behind on these weekly Engineering-notebooks, but I am trying to keep up with each week, although I am a little behind.
